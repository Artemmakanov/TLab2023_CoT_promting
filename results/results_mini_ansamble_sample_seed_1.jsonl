Hence after buying one balloon, the total amount of air is 1000*0.10 = 10 L. Now, 1000 L is 'consumed' as we bought / expanded the first balloon. Hence before expanding the first balloon, the bank had 2000 L of air to be spent. Note that at 1000 balloons, we spend exactly 50 more tanks of gas. Hence after expanding the first 50 balloons, there were 1950 tanks of air available. Note that when we have a balloon with exactly 10 L of air, we spend exactly 50 more banks of gas to expand it to 20 L. So after expanding the first 100 balloons (we have 50 more balloons with 10 L of air and 150 balloons with 20 L of air) we already have 2000-0= 1950 banks of gas. The next cotton-ball has 30 L of air. Thus the bank of is 1000-0+0= 1950 -50, that is 1950/30, or 700 banks of air left to be spent. Hence after buyong the next 100 balloons we spent 950 domesticated air, which is same as 700. So we still have 230 more. Hence to buy the last 200 balloons we also need to spend 950 domesticated air. Hence we now have 2000-50-0= 1950 + 950 = 1991, that is 1991-round. So the number of round needed to buy all the gas is 1991-100= 1981. The answer is 1981.
